There are far more people who gamble on occasion than there are people who are compulsive gamblers.", "It has been estimated that around 80 percent of the US population has gambled in their lifetime. Gambling can be done in various different ways and therefore is easy for people to access.", "Pathological gamblers are significantly more likely to have mental health disorders and/or substance use disorders.", "A research study found that 75% of gamblers had an alcohol disorder, 38% had a drug use disorder, and 60% were nicotine dependent.", "50% of gamblers have experienced a mood disorder, 41.3% had experienced an anxiety disorder, and 60.8% had experienced a personality disorder.", "Men are more likely to develop a gambling problem than women.", "It is estimated that three to four percent of the American population has a gambling problem; this is approximately between six to eight million people.", "The last gambling addiction fact to remember is that compulsive gambling does not mean that you are a weak person.
